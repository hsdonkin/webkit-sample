1. get Node.js and run command
    $ npm init -y

2. install webpack:
    $ npm install webpack@4.19.1 --save-dev-exact

    "exact" in this line is version pinning, where you explicitly say
    that you need this specific model of webpack

3. install webpack CLI (command line interface)
    $ npm install webpack-cli@2.0.9 --save-dev

4. install packages for production and development:
    template command:
    $ npm install PACKAGE-NAME-HERE --save

5. add .gitignore file and open in text editor
   add node_modules and .DS_Store, because these are freaking huge
   and shouldn't be included when you upload to github. Dist also
   can be added here, because what you uplaod to github is
   just for your development later.

   node_modules/
   .DS_Store
   dist/

6. Check out package.json and make sure all your stuff is in there

7. Edit package.json and tell it you need to run the script for
   build webpack:

   "scripts": {
     "build": "webpack"
   },

8. Configure webpack by creating a file called webpack.config.js.
   Add this code to that file:

      const path = require('path');

      module.exports = {
        entry: './src/main.js',
        output: {
          filename: 'bundle.js',
          path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
        }
      };

      ------------------------

      The "entry point" is where webpack enters the application, so it's
      like your big control section. It's like the header in your index.html,
      except it's your JS file.

      The "output" is the new minified JS file that will hold all your stuff!

9. Make a new JS file for any custom logic you're writing:
    YOURFILENAME.js

    Any objects you create in there, you can import into your main.js file.
    Prototypes are automagically imported when you import the object.

    ### Buyer beware! Troubleshooting JS issues becomes really hard because
    the JS will be minified and none of your variables are the same name.
    Goodbye easy console logs in the browser window.

    main.js
    --------------
    import { Triangle } from './../js/YOURFILENAME.js';


    YOURFILENAME.js
    --------------
    export function Triangle(side1, side2, side3) {
      this.side1 = side1;
      etc etc etc
    }

    Triangle.prototype.sayHello = function(){
      console.log("Hello!");
    }


10. Install style-loader and css-loader so you can get CSS in your
    page. Otherwise, it'll bundle everything without it!

    Steps to success: install the loaders, update your webpack config,
    set up an import line in main.js, create a styles.css file.

    $ npm install style-loader@0.20.2 --save-dev
    $ npm install css-loader@0.28.10 --save-dev

    webpack.config.js
    ------------
    const path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      entry: './src/main.js',
      output: {
        filename: 'bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
      },
      module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: /\.css$/,
            use: [
              'style-loader',
              'css-loader'
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    };


    main.js
    ----------
    import './styles.css';

    styles.css
    ----------
    body{
    background-color: #adfafa;
    }

11. Install HTMLWebpackPlugin so that webpack will generate a new html
    file for your when it compiles everything.

    $ npm install html-webpack-plugin@3.0.6 --save-dev

        new code:

        const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

        module.exports{
        ////// some stuff here
        },

        plugins: [
          new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
           title: 'Your Page Name',
           template: './src/index.html',
           inject: 'body'
           })
         ],

         module: {
         //// some stuff here
         }
       ] /// annoying
      }  /// staircase
    };   /// of doom

12. Install the webpack cleanup plugin! This deletes everything in the
    dist folder every time you build, so all your changes get updated.

    $ npm install clean-webpack-plugin@0.1.18 --save-dev

    webpack.config.js
    ------------
    const CleanWebpackPlugin = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

    module.exports = {

      /// some stuff here

      plugins: [
        new CleanWebpackPlugin(['dist']),
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
          title: 'Your Page Name',
          template: './src/index.html',
          inject: 'body'
        })
      ],

      /// some stuff here

    }

14. Create a build and watch npm not work. Go back, and try and figure out
    where the typo in your project is.

    $ npm run build

15. Common troubleshooting:
    - is there an index.html in your src file?
    - is there a body element in that index.html?
    - is your css linked in the main.js file?
    - did you install something, and then never connect it in webpack.config.js?
